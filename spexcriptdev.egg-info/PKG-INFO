Description: SpeXcript -- makes your spex script beautiful
        =============================================
        
        SpeXcript is a markup and layout system for scripts of theater plays or 
        musicals etc. I originally made it for Fyysikkospeksi, a spex made every
        other year by mostly Engineering Physics undergraduate and graduate students 
        at Aalto University. For now, it has only been for our internal use, but I 
        am now (2015) releasing it for free and as open source. 
        It would make me happy if someone else finds this useful.
        
        Any feedback or suggestions are very welcome: koos.zevenhoven@aalto.fi.
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * Python 3.4 (May work with older versions, but no official support)
        * ``pdflatex`` (For pdf output, pdflatex executable must be on the path)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        spexcript can be installed with ``pi3``, often ``pip3`` for Python 3 (make sure you have it installed):
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip3 install spexcript
        
        
        or directly from the source code:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            git clone https://github.com/k7hoven/spexcript.git
            cd spexcript
            python3 setup.py install 
        
        Basic Usage
        ===========
        
        The documentation for the markup language itself is on its way, but if you
        have a spexcript file, say ``myspex.sxt``, you can lay it out as pdf from the
        command line as  follows:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ python -m spexcript myspex.sxt
        
        The interface and documentation will be further improved in the future.
